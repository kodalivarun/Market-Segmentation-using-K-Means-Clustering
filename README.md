# Market-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering

In this project we are trying to perform customer market segmentation.

So you have been hired as a Data Scientist to a bank in New York City.

The bank has extensive data about their customers.

For the past six months the marketing team at the bank wanted to launch a targeted ad marketing campaign by dividing the customers into at least three different groups/clusters(so we're going to talk a lot about the clusters in this project infact we're going to use k means clustering algorithm in this project).

So basically the marketing team based on the customers mindset will be able to launch a targeted marketing campaign.

They want to learn and understand about their customers.

They want to know the spending habits of the customers.

So that's basically the objective of this project.



# Step that we're going to see in this project:

1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualize customers data set using distplot, histograms and KDE.

2. Learn how to fill out Missing data points or null elements.

3. Understanding the K Means clustering algorithm.

4. Learn how to find the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

5. Apply k means algorithm and sklearn to perform market segmentation.

6. Understand the intuition behind principle component analysis with PCA.

7. Apply PCA to perform dimensionality reduction on the data set.
